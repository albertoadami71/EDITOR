  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p class=''>In this project, we developed a product using the Shiny application that allows the integration of the R software features and the user interaction facilities provided by HTML pages and the JavaScript language;</p>

<p class=''>The product is a short message editor with the ability to predict the next word to be entered;</p>

<p class=''>The method was implemented and shared through a Web application. The demo version is available in <a href="https://astolfo.shinyapps.io/EDITOR/">https://astolfo.shinyapps.io/EDITOR/</a> and the full version can be found at GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/albertoadami71/EDITOR.git">https://github.com/albertoadami71/EDITOR.git</a>). </p>

    <h2>Method</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p class=''>The model implemented in our product is very simple and is based on analysis of the frequency of a word or two, three or four words sequences in a data set; </p>

<p class=''>The data set (corpora) consists of text files containing phrases in English extracted from the web pages: blogs, news and twitters. We did the analysis of the frequency of words in the texts and also verified the occurrences of 2, 3 and 4 words sequences (2-grams, 3-grams and 4-grams);</p>

<p class=''>The data set size is 265 MB, containing 3 million lines and 40 million words. Below we have samples of frequencies lists of words and sequences of two words.</p>

<pre><code>##   KEY   VALUE
## 1 the 2941111
## 2  to 1921469
## 3 and 1587629
## 4   a 1572568
## 5   i 1494765
## 6  of 1292993
</code></pre>

    <h2>Method</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <pre><code>##       KEY  VALUE
## 1  of the 257501
## 2  in the 245543
## 3 for the 137170
## 4  to the 135534
## 5  on the 128928
## 6   to be 118263
</code></pre>

<p class=''>The idea is this: suppose we type &quot;do&quot;, then the script shows a list of suggestions, &quot;don&#39;t; done; doesn&#39;t; door; dog; doctor&quot;. We choose &quot;don&#39;t&quot; and, after that, we type &quot;wo&quot;, then the script shows another list: &quot;worry; work&quot;, because the sequences &quot;don&#39;t worry&quot; and  &quot;don&#39;t work&quot; occur frequently in texts. We select &quot;worry&quot; and thus we spend less time and effort to type the phrase &quot;don&#39;t worry&quot;. As we will see below, we obtained promising results using this strategy;</p>

<p class=''>We applied the algorithm in a text with 1 million words and we found a hit rate of about 80%. We consider a hit when the user type the two first characters, after that the script displays a list of 5 words and one of these 5 suggestions coincides with the next word of the text.</p>

    <h2>Product Features</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p class=''>We provide a text area in which the user will enter his message. When desired, the user can push the button that will allow the display of a list of suggestions for the next word. After selecting one of the suggestions, the selected word will appear in the text area at the cursor position;</p>

<p class=''>In addition to the predefined lists of words, we have a list that is being fed with the words typed by the user itself. It is a kind of online learning;</p>

<p class=''>Although locally the application works well, unfortunately we could not run the script with the complete word files on the shinyapps.io server. We got the message: &quot;Disconnect from the server&quot;. The web application could only work when we reduce our lists of suggestions for just a few hundred words, eliminating the ability to predict the next words. This is not a memory problem, because even the full version is a small size app that uses less than 250MB!   </p>

<p class=''>We then consider that the version available in shinyapps.io is just a demo. The full version can be obtained from GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/albertoadami71/EDITOR.git">https://github.com/albertoadami71/EDITOR.git</a>) and runs locally;</p>

<p class=''>We hope you enjoy our product, we worked hard to do it! Despite the problems we had with shinyapps.io, our app works fine and is very fun to use!</p>
